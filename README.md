# Java Tutorial by Rituraj Mahato
I have created this Java + Data Structures and Algorithms Tutorials Repository to share the knowledge I gained while learning.

✳️ Most of the files will contain some additional piece of information.

🗂 Methods - Java <br>

<p align="justify">A method is a block of code or collection of statements or a set of code grouped together to perform a certain task or operation. It is used to achieve the reusability of code. We write a method once and use it many times. We do not require to write code again and again. It also provides the easy modification and readability of code, just by adding or removing a chunk of code. The method is executed only when we call or invoke it.</p>

✅ CheckPrime Program <br>

✅ Overloading Program <br>

<p align="justify">🎯 Overloading allows different methods to have the same name, but different signatures where the signature can differ by the number of input parameters or type of input parameters or both. Overloading is related to compile-time (or static) polymorphism.</p>

✅ Parameters in Java <br>

<p align="justify">Parameters are specified after the method name, inside the parentheses. You can add as many parameters as you want, just separate them with a comma.</p>

<p align="justify">Arguments in Java are the actual values that are passed to variables defined in the method header when the method is called from another method.</p>
